One interesting thing (which also ended up being frustrating until I figured it out) was the way that the arc function worked,
with the radians. It took me a bit to realize that you needed to look at the whole unit circle from a different angle, which

Also, I was reminded once again that my eyebrows are really, *really* **thick**. Fun times.
