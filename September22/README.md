##Assignment 2: Repetitive Art

This initially started as me trying to make what Casey Reas showed in his lecture, but I realized that I didn't actually
have that kind of skill so I ended up changing a few things here and there and made it a bit more interactive and different.
Making the equation work and getting the lines to draw whenever two circles (they're hidden on the actual run) meet was kinda
difficult but I made it work somehow (through some thoughtful hardcoding haha).

While working on this project, I kinda had one of those revalations that people get from time to time about life and portrayed
it here. The first phase (initial) shows the surface level connections that we make in life, or maybe the decisions that we believe set
our lives in a different direction. The second phase (after a click) shows the all of the connections that go unnoticed, those
moments that we didn't (and probably will never) realize had an affect on who we are today. It's just some food for thought :)
